## Air Quality mobile app

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hiep2x/air_quality/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### How to use:

1. By default, the app fetchs Air information of the current device's location.
2. You can pick anywhere you want by clicking on the top-left button, a Google map screen will appear, then scroll/swipe the map to the location you want to know the Air Quality. Finally click the blue bottom-right button to go to the Detail info screen.

### Permission:

1. Location permission: this app needs the location permission in order to get lat/lon of your current location, than fetch Air quality of your location.
